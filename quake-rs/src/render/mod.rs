//! A from-scratch software rasteriser driven by the parsed BSP data.
//!
//! This is **not** a port of Quake's asm-heavy `d_*.c` span renderer (the
//! original `WinQuake` software pipeline walked the BSP front-to-back, built
//! edge tables, and emitted affine-textured spans via hand-tuned x86). Instead
//! this module is a small, self-contained, allocation-light triangle
//! rasteriser written purely against the *parsed* [`Bsp`] lump records produced
//! by [`crate::bsp`]: it reconstructs each face polygon from the
//! surfedge/edge/vertex tables, transforms it into camera space, perspective
//! projects it, fan-triangulates, and fills triangles with barycentric
//! coverage plus a per-pixel depth buffer. Shading is a flat per-face Lambert
//! term over a stable per-surface hue — no palette, no lightmaps, no textures.
//!
//! Design goals, in priority order:
//!  * **Memory safety.** No `unsafe` (the crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`),
//!    no external crates — only `std`.
//!  * **Never panic on BSP-derived data.** Every index into a lump goes through
//!    `.get()`; a face referencing an out-of-range edge, surfedge, vertex,
//!    plane, or texinfo is silently skipped rather than indexed blindly. The
//!    only direct indexing is into our own freshly-allocated framebuffers,
//!    where the index is provably in bounds.
//!  * **Determinism.** Given the same `Bsp` and `Camera`, the output `Image` is
//!    bit-for-bit reproducible (no floating-point nondeterminism beyond IEEE).
//!
//! Coordinate conventions (Quake world space): `+X` east, `+Y` north, `+Z` up.
//! The camera looks down its own `+forward`; see [`render_bsp`] for the full
//! view transform and projection.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! This file keeps `r_main.c`'s share: [`Image`], [`Camera`], the flat
//! [`render_bsp`] and the `render_scene*` entry points (`R_RenderView`). The rest
//! follows id's files: `view` (view.c), `world` (r_bsp.c), `raster` (the
//! triangle fillers), `light` (r_light.c, `R_BuildLightMap`), `surf` (r_surf.c,
//! d_surf.c), `warp` (d_scan.c's turbulence), `sky` (r_sky.c, d_sky.c), `vis`
//! (PVS, frustum, near clip), `alias` (r_alias.c, r_aclip.c), `polyse`
//! (d_polyse.c), `sprite` (r_sprite.c), `part` (r_part.c), `stats` (the
//! profiler). The 2-D layer is beside it: [`crate::draw`], [`crate::screen`],
//! [`crate::sbar`], [`crate::menu`], [`crate::keys`], [`crate::console`].

/// world-then-models ordering; correctness does not depend on the order because
/// the shared depth buffer resolves visibility per pixel. Passing an empty
/// `bmodels`/`external` slice and `None` `viewmodel` reproduces [`render_scene`]
/// exactly.
///
/// ## External brush models (item boxes)
/// `external` is the set of standalone `b_*.bsp` item boxes — Quake's
/// `misc_explobox` and the ammo/health pickup boxes (see [`ExternalBModel`]).
/// Each entry borrows its own parsed [`Bsp`] and is drawn (MODEL 0, translated to
/// the item origin) by the same brush-face path as the world submodels, **after**
/// the world and inline submodels but before the alias models, sharing the one
/// z-buffer so the box occludes / is occluded correctly. These boxes are not
/// dynamically lit in the original game, so they take the static (or fullbright)
/// lightmap. An empty `external` slice draws nothing — byte-identical to the
/// pre-external renderer, which is why every prior caller passes `&[]`.
///
/// The `viewmodel`, when present, is drawn **last and on top** of everything:
/// it is anchored to the camera (Quake's `cl.viewent`) and uses its own depth
/// buffer ([`draw_viewmodel`]), so a wall directly ahead can never hide the gun
/// and the shared world depth buffer is left untouched.
///
/// `time` is the game/server time in seconds, used to animate the special
/// surfaces: liquid faces (miptex name `*…`) get the Quake turbulent SIN warp
/// and sky faces (miptex name `sky…`) get the two-layer scroll. An advancing
/// `time` makes water ripple and sky drift; `time == 0` renders them static
/// (still textured, just not animated). The turbulent sine table is built once
/// per call (a plain `[f32; 256]`, no global state) and shared with the world
/// and brush-submodel passes. Walls, alias models, and the viewmodel ignore
/// `time` entirely.
///
/// ## Particles
/// `particles` is the live set of engine particles (Quake's `particle()`
/// builtin effect: explosions, spawns, blood), each a `(world_pos, palette
/// index)` pair. They are drawn **after** the world / submodels / alias models
/// but **before** the camera-anchored viewmodel, sharing the same internal
/// z-buffer — so a particle behind a wall is correctly hidden, while the gun
/// still wins (its 1/z is tripled, as `R_AliasDrawModel` does). Passing an
/// empty `particles` slice draws no particles and leaves the image identical to
/// the pre-particle behaviour, which is why [`render_scene`] and every prior
/// caller can pass `&[]`.
///
/// DESIGN NOTE: the particle slice is a trailing parameter on `render_scene_ext`
/// (option (b) of the task) rather than a separate `draw_particles`-after-render
/// entry point. `render_scene_ext` returns only the `Image`, not its z-buffer,
/// so a standalone post-pass could not depth-test against the world; threading
/// the slice through here lets the particles share the buffer that already
/// exists. [`draw_particles`] is still exposed as a standalone `pub fn` for
/// direct testing of the projection + z-test against a caller-owned buffer.
///
/// ## Dynamic lights
/// `dlights` is the live set of [`crate::dlight::DynamicLight`]s (explosions,
/// muzzle flashes, `EF_*` light effects). They are folded into each lightmapped
/// world (and brush-submodel) face per `R_AddDynamicLights`: a light that
/// reaches a face brightens its luxels, raising the per-pixel lightmap factor
/// near the impact point. Sky and liquid faces are `TEX_SPECIAL` (fullbright, no
/// lightmap) and are never dlit, matching the C. Passing an **empty** `dlights`
/// slice leaves every face borrowing its static lightmap bytes, so the output is
/// byte-identical to the pre-dlight renderer — which is why [`render_scene`] and
/// the demo tests pass `&[]`.
///
/// ## Animated light styles
/// `light_styles` is the per-style brightness scale (`[f32; 64]`, `1.0` ==
/// normal), produced by [`crate::server::Server::lightstyle_scales`] from the
/// map's flickering/pulsing patterns (`R_AnimateLight`). Each lightmapped face
/// selects up to four styles via its `styles[0..3]` slots; the lightmap is the
/// sum of each style's baked luxel block scaled by its `light_styles` value
/// (`R_BuildLightMap`), computed BEFORE dynamic lights are added. Passing the
/// neutral [`NEUTRAL_LIGHTSTYLE_SCALES`] (all `1.0`) reproduces the static
/// style-0 lightmap byte-for-byte, which is what [`render_scene`] does — so the
/// demo tests are unchanged. The animated front-ends pass the live scales each
/// frame to make torches flicker and lights pulse.
///
/// ## Colormap (exact Quake shading)
/// `colormap` is Quake's `gfx/colormap.lmp`: `64 * 256` bytes — 64 light rows of
/// 256 palette indices each, row 0 brightest, row 63 darkest. When `Some`, a lit
/// wall pixel is shaded the way the software renderer does: the per-pixel
/// lightmap brightness selects a colormap ROW (`colormap_row`, ported from
/// `R_BuildLightMap`'s bound/invert/shift), `colormap[row*256 + texel]` yields a
/// PALETTE INDEX, and the final colour is `palette[that index]` — an index
/// lookup that bakes Quake's non-linear darkening and CANNOT overbright past the
/// base colour. Liquids and sky stay fullbright at row 0 (`colormap[texel]`).
/// When `None`, the renderer keeps the legacy linear `palette[texel] *
/// brightness` multiply byte-for-byte, so [`render_scene`] and every existing
/// caller/test are unchanged. A colormap shorter than `64*256` bytes is ignored
/// (treated as `None`) rather than read out of bounds.
